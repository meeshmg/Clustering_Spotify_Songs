# Clustering_Spotify_Songs

This repository contains the Python notebook for a project in which I tuned multiple different clustering algorithms to cluster Spotify songs based on their characteristics.

I then measured the performance of the clustering algorithms both to each other with different parameters and to other clustering algorithms.

I tested multiple Dimensionality reduction techniques to choose which visualization showed the results of the Clustering in the best way.
